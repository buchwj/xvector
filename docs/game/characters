  NPCs, Characters and Stats

 Introduction
--------------

This document describes characters and their properties.  Characters are very
similar in nature to NPCs; they share many of the same properties, including
names, appearances, and stats.  Characters are unique, however, in that they
are player controlled (no AI) and have skills.


-----------------------
 A Common Base: Entity
-----------------------

Characters and NPCs are considered to be derived from a common base, the Entity
class.  Entities are objects in the game which act "alive" and have stats.
They do not have any definition of behavior.  Their properties are described
in this section.

:: Entity Stats ::

 - Level
    - All entities have a level which describes their difficulty or
      advancement.  For players, this is a measure of how "leveled up" a
      player is; for NPCs, this is an arbitrary number chosen by the designer
      to represent the difficulty of the NPC.  In either case, it has no actual
      effect on the game.
 - HP / Max HP
    - Health.  All entities possess both a current HP and a maximum HP.  The
      maximum HP sets an upper bound on the amount of health the entity may
      have; the current HP keeps track of how wounded the entity has, an entity
      being considered "dead" when current HP reaches zero.
 - SP / Max SP
    - Stamina.  Like HP, all entities possess both a current SP and a maximum
      SP.  SP is used when using skills and certain special moves.  Unlike HP,
      there is no consequence for SP reaching zero.
 - MP / Max MP
    - Mana.  Like HP, all entities possess both a current MP and a maximum MP.
      MP is used for casting spells and performing certain special moves.
      Unlike HP, there is no consequence for MP reaching zero.
 - Strength
    - Strength is the primary physical stat of all entities.  It is used in
      determining the damage dealt by physical attacks.  It can also be used
      by players in determining the success rate or effectiveness of physical
      skills.
 - Dexterity
    - Dexterity is to physical defense what Strength is to physical offense.
      It is used in determining the damage received from physical attacks.  It
      can also be used by players in determining the success rate or
      effectiveness of physical skills.  For players, having a higher Dexterity
      when leveling up will result in a greater increase in Max SP.
 - Constitution
    - Constitution is the health stat.  It affects things like health regen
      rate.  Like other stats, it can be used in determining the success rate
      or effectiveness of certain skills.  For players, having a higher
      Constitution when leveling up will result in a greater increase in Max
      HP.
 - Agility
    - Agility is the speed stat.  It affects things like attack speed, casting
      rate, and evasion.
 - Intelligence
    - Intelligence is to magic offense what Strength is to physical offense.
      It is used in determining the damage dealt by magic attacks.  Like other
      stats, it can be used in determining the success rate or effectiveness
      of magic-based skills.  For players, having a higher Intelligence (along
      with Wisdom) when leveling up will result in a greater increase in Max
      MP.
 - Wisdom
    - Wisdom is to magic defense what Dexterity is to physical defense.  It is
      used in determining the damage received from magic attacks.  Like other
      stats, it can be used in determining the success rate or effectiveness
      of magic-based skills.  For players, having a higher Wisdom (along with
      Intelligence) when leveling up will result in a greater increase in Max
      MP.
