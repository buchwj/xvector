 CLIENT

	SOUND:

		PyAudiere
			Pros: Multiple file streaming support
			Cons: No support for OS X
		
		pySonic
			Pros: Everything we need
			Cons: License hell, especially if this goes commercial in any way
			
		Pygame   <<<<<< USE THIS
			Pros: Everything we need, cross-platform
			Cons: Big overhead; lots of features we don't need
		
		Phonon
			Pros: Comes with PyQt4, plus support for streaming video
			Cons: Can't layer sounds (i.e., no SFX on top of BGM)
				* Consider using this solely for video.  This requires testing
				  to determine if it can run parallel to Pygame's audio library.
		
		PyAudio
			Pros: Widely cross-platform
			Cons: Blocking API, would need to be isolated to a separate thread
				  Unstable ("super-duper alpha quality" according to website)

		Using PyQt4.
		
	NETWORK:
	
		Twisted.
