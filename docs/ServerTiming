  Server Timing

 Server Timer
==============

The server timer must be designed with a number of issues in mind.  These
issues all stem from the persistent nature of the MMO server; the timer will
never reset once it has started, and if the server restarts, the timer will
pick right back up where it left off.

We also want to have a reasonably high-precision timer.  Timing events in
whole seconds is not precise enough; rather, we want to use milliseconds.  The
advantages to a millisecond timer are that it provides a level of precision
greater than that which the average player will observe (try counting to 1000
in one second), yet it is a precision which is available on almost every
platform.

The disadvantage of a millisecond timer is the potentially large value the
timer can have.  The timer will increment by 1000 every second; given an
unsigned 32-bit integer with a maximum value of 2^32 seconds, this gives us
about 49 days of runtime before the timer maxes out.  While this might be
acceptable for a game which is not persistent, MMOs are expected to be around
for longer than 49 days before the server is reset.

The solution is to use a 64-bit integer - a "long integer" in Python.  These
give us a maximum value of 2^64, or somewhere around 500 million years.  It
would be reasonable to assume that no server will operate for 500 million
years without a reset, nevermind that a player base will survive (literally!)
for 500 million years.
