<!--
  This is the default configuration file for the xVector Engine Server.
  All standard options are documented here; please read the comments above
  the option before you change it.
  
  Please remember that all element names and argument names are case-sensitive.
  If you want to use the default value, simply set the value in the file to
  "!!default!!"; the server will replace any instance of "!!default!!" with the
  default value.  This is good for using default values that differ between
  platforms (i.e. directory paths, etc.)

      Network Settings
      
      This section contains basic settings for how the server uses the network. 
      -->
    <Network>
        <!--
          The server will bind to this address.
          In most cases you will want to leave Interface as "0.0.0.0"; this
          will allow the server to listen on all network interfaces.
          You will also probably want to leave Port as "24020"; this is the
          default port.
          
          Default values:
            Interface="0.0.0.0"
            Port="24020"
          
          Accessed from the code as:
            Network.Address.Interface
            Network.Address.Port
          -->
        <Address Interface="0.0.0.0" Port="24020" />
        
        <!--
          This is the maximum number of connections the server will accept.
          Set this to whatever you feel like (at least 1, no more than about
          two billion).  Of course, if you actually manage to get a million
          connections, a single server probably can't handle it.
          
          Default value:
            Max="50"
          
          Accessed from the code as:
            Network.Connections.Max
          -->
        <Connections Max="50" />

    <!--
      Log Settings
      
      This section allows you to customize how and where the server stores its
      log files.
      -->
    <Logging>
        <!--
          This is the directory to which all log files are stored.
          It can be either an absolute or relative path.
          The user account under which the server is running must be able to
          write to this directory.
          
          Default value:
            Path="!!default!!"
              which is the same as:
                Windows: "logs"
                Linux: "/var/log/xvector"
          
          Accessed from the code as:
            Logging.Directory.Path 
          -->
        <Directory Path="!!default!!" />
        
        <!--
          This controls the behavior of the log file rotator.
          The rotator ensures that logs do not overflow and flood the system;
          it enforces a maximum log size and keeps a given number of old logs.
          Both the maximum size and number of old logs are set here.  The size
          is given in bytes (1024 bytes = 1 KB, 1024 KB = 1 MB).
          
          Default value:
            MaxSize="4194304"   (4 MB)
            LogCount="10"
          
          Accessed from the code as:
            Logging.Rotator.MaxSize
            Logging.Rotator.LogCount
          -->
        <Rotator MaxSize="4194304" LogCount="10" />
